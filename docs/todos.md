## Access-Token

- [x] **Token Expiration:** Handle Access Token Expiration on Client
- [ ] **Token Storing:** Use a more secured way to persist access token than local storage (cookies? refresh tokens?)

## New-Features

- [ ] **Email Confirmation:** Send email & Make confirmation route
- [ ] **Image Uploading:** Upload user avatar image (instead of URL only)

## Bugs-Fix

- [ ] **Case Sensitivity:** Data querying is case sensitive. For example, a user with an uppercase name won't be found when accessing his profile from the address bar with lowercase input
